#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -- the while loop is dependent on n 


b) O(n^2) -- the while loop is nested


c) O(n) -- function runs n times

## Exercise II

I would use recursion to solve this problem.  The way I'd start to solve it is to begin at the nth floor.  I would drop the egg from the nth floor and check if it broke.  If no, the gather my eggs and go up 1 floor and drop 1 egg again to see if it breaks.

I would repeat the process until one egg breaks.  This makes it O(n) runtime complexity because of recursion of "n" number of times.
